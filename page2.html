          <p>
            Treaty 3 takes up most of eastern <span style="color: yellow">Ontario</span> and a little bit of west
            <span style="color: yellow">Manitoba</span>. Compared to the sizes of other treaties, it is somewhat small.

        <h1>WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THIS TREATY</h1>
        <p>The historic terms of treaty 3 were that any indigenous family of five or more would get one square mile of land
          which could be used for farms and reserves. They could also fish and hunt for food on those lands.
          The people living there would also get paid five dollars (which was a lot at the time) yearly every year.
          And schools would be established in those areas, so indigenous kids could go there to learn.
          In exchange for all of this, the Canadian Government would be able to control the lands and the people.
          To learn more, watch this video about community-based monitoring that they are doing in treaty 3.
