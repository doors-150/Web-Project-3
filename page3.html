      <h1>HISTORY OF TREATY 3</h1>
      <div class="article-inline">

        <!--First article-->
        <article>
          <p>As said before, the government and the engineers had to be on the good side of the Ojibwe people so that they would
            allow them to build the road-water system. So the government sent a worker of the Hudson's bay company to go there
            and explain the project to the people living there.
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>While the Ojibwe were open to the offer, they wanted to be paid for the construction that would go through
            their territory, along with some food and supplies. When the worker went back to tell this to the government,
            they instantly refused because they thought the indigenous were asking for too much.
            But they were still open for a treaty.
          </p>

        <!--Second article-->
        <article>
          <p>
          After many negociations, on <span style="color: yellow">October 3rd, 1873</span>, the Saulteaux (Ojibwe) and the governor of
          Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, Alexander Morris signed treaty 3
          after many negociations. The treaty took four years to actually happen due to conflicts and
          disagreements between the two sides.
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
          When it was finally signed, the
          indigenous people had to go to all the communities and explain the
          treaty to them. Some changes were also made shortly after the treaty was
          signed, for example the Metis became allowed to join the treaty because
          they wanted to. It took until 1875 for the treaty to fully be completed.

          <p>Not much has really happened since the treaty was signed, but in 2003 it got its own police force called
          the Treaty Three Police. They are self-administered and are under the First Nations Policing Program.
          They serve 20,000 residents and 23 total communities in Treaty 3.</p>

          <h1>MORE ABOUT TREATY THREE POLICE</h1>
          <p>Along with serving their communities, The Treaty Three Police also celebrate their indigenous cultures.
          They have three traditional items that are: "The Drum", "The Pipe", and "The Eagle Staff".
          The Drum is an Okichida Drum that is used to help the police officers work, by giving them strength and supporting them
          spiritually. The Pipe is used to teach people. It is used with a bowl that has tobacco placed in it for a fire.
          The Eagle Staff is used to represent the strength of the police officers and the communities.
          The staff has 23 eagle feathers, one for each community. The Treaty Three Police also uses four strategies.
          They meet the standards of the Ontario Police Service Act, are community-based, have focus on employees' mental health,
          and build relationships with their communities. Watch this video as it goes more in depth of the history of treaty 3.
