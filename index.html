            <article>
              <p>Treaty 3 is one of the treaties that were made in Canada between the 

                <!--span being used-->
                <span style="color: yellow;">Government</span> and the 
                <span style="color: yellow;">Indigenous</span> people in 1873. It covers areas in both
                Ontario and 
                Manitoba. The location as to where this treaty was negociated was in a place called
                the Lake of the Woods.
              </p>
            </br>
              <p>It all started in 1869, when the Government of Canada wanted to create a road and water system
              from Lower fort garry, Manitoba to northwest Ontario.
              It would have to go through the territory of where the Ojibwe people lived,
              so the engineers of this project knew that if they wanted this to be successful,
              they would need to have good relations with the indigenous people in that area.

            <p>This treaty is also known as the Northwest-Angle treaty because that was the part of the Lake of the Woods
              where the treaty was signed. Below is a map of its location.

            <p>It took years to be signed and went through a lot of negociations and changes.
              Because of that, this is an important historic agreement that has helped shape Canada to what it is today.
